    """ Evaluate blurring of the map based on number_of_occupied_pixels/number_of_state-know_pixels.
    A high proportion, compared to another map, mean blurred walls ; thus, not clear map.
    That's a criteria, only considering wall blurring. It's not THE criteria.
    To determine if a pixel is free or a wall, we look if he is > (free) or < (wall) to pixels mean.
    Sometimes, wall thickness/blurring is not relevant of quality
    (error in loop closure -> generating big map -> lot of free space compared to wall generation -> great proportion...)
